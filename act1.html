<h2 id="id1"> Lets explore </h2>  
<p class="c1">Nature is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this
general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans
are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate
and even superior to nature.</p>
